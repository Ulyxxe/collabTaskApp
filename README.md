# General Information

Module **II.1102** offers students the opportunity to work on a **Java development project**. This year, the project will focus on developing an application that manages collaborative tasks with all the required features. More information on this topic in section 2. Before describing the needs of this project, here are some general instructions:

1. You will need to form **teams of 2 or 3 students** by filling out the form for each teaching group in the **‘Java Project’** section of the Moodle course space (teams are formed within the same teaching groups).
2. The **source codes** of your projects will be compared to detect any attempt at **code sharing**. If there is even the slightest suspicion of cheating, you will be interviewed by your teachers to prove that you are the authors of your own projects.
3. It is absolutely **forbidden to use code generation tools**. This will be considered as **plagiarism**.
4. **Bonuses** may be awarded for original features of your choice.

# Project Presentation: Collaborative Task Management Application

A company specializing in consulting and developing IT solutions is based in Paris. The company is expanding and wants to introduce new mechanisms for **project management**. The management has decided to incorporate a **collaborative task management tool** into the company's information system. Such a tool is effective for organizing project tasks, sharing responsibilities, and tracking the progress of deliverables. It allows team members to work together in real-time, while having a clear view of the progress of each task.

A **collaborative task management application** will enable the company to achieve the following objectives:

- Create an **intuitive environment** for task management, suitable for teams of different sizes and sectors.
- Facilitate **collaboration** by allowing users to share information, files, and updates in real time.
- Improve **productivity** by integrating automation and communication features between project members.
- Allow **advanced customization** to adapt to users' specific workflows.

1. General Information
Module II.1102 offers students the opportunity to work on a Java development project. This
year, the project will focus on developing an application that manages collaborative tasks with
all the required features. More information on this topic in section 2. Before describing the
needs of this project, here are some general instructions:
1. 1. You will need to form teams of 2 or 3 students by filling out the form for each
teaching group in the ‘Java Project’ section of the Moodle course space (Teams are
formed within the same teaching groups).
2. The source codes of your projects will be compared to detect any attempt at code
sharing. If there is even the slightest suspicion of cheating, you will be interviewed by
your teachers to prove that you are the authors of your own projects.
3. It is absolutely forbidden to use code generation tools. This will be considered as
plagiarism.
4. Bonuses may be awarded for original features of your choice.
2. Project presentation: Collaborative task management
application
A company specializing in consulting and developing IT solutions is based in Paris. The
company is expanding and wants to introduce new mechanisms for project management. The
management has decided to incorporate a collaborative task management tool into the
company's information system. Such a tool is effective for organizing project tasks, sharing
responsibilities, and tracking the progress of deliverables. It allows team members to work
together in real time, while having a clear view of the progress of each task.
A collaborative task management application will enable the company to achieve the following
objectives:
• Create an intuitive environment for task management, suitable for teams of
different sizes and sectors,
• Facilitate collaboration by allowing users to share information, files and updates in
real time,
• Improve productivity by integrating automation and communication features between
project members,
• Allow advanced customization to adapt to users' specific workflows.

4. Technical constraints
• The applicaNon must be developed in Java using object-oriented programming
concepts,
• Use of appropriate data structures for storing informaNon (tables, lists, etc.),
• Use of JavaFX for creaNng applicaNon interfaces,
• Possible use of databases for persistent data storage (opNonal).
5. Deliverables
Several deliverables will be submitted on Moodle during the semester:
• A first concerning the UML modeling of your project. It is important to model your
project well in order to then design a more robust program that is easier to modify if
necessary (Friday, January 10, 2025).
• At the end of the semester, you will have to submit a technical document describing
the implementation of your project as well as the source code of the project.
• A defense will be planned in the last session of the semester (Friday, January 17, 2025)
during which you will have to explain the design of your project and demonstrate it.
More information will be communicated to you as it becomes available on Moodle.
